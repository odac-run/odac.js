# Project Context & Design Philosophy

## Project Identity
- **Type:** Node.js Framework
- **Goal:** To provide a robust, enterprise-ready backbone for web applications.

## Core Priorities (The "Big 3")
1.  **Enterprise-Level Security:** 
    - Security is not an afterthought; it is foundational. 
    - Default to secure settings. 
    - Validate all inputs. 
    - Sanitize outputs. 
    - Use established cryptographic standards.
2.  **Zero-Config:** 
    - The framework should work "out of the box" with sensible defaults. 
    - Configuration should be optional, not mandatory for getting started. 
    - "Convention over Configuration" is key.
3.  **High Performance:** 
    - Code must be optimized for throughput and low latency. 
    - Avoid unnecessary overhead. 
    - Profile and benchmark critical paths. 
    - Memory management is crucial.

## Interaction Guidelines for AI
- Always assume the user wants the most efficient and secure solution unless specified otherwise.
- When suggesting architecture, prioritize scalability and maintainability.
