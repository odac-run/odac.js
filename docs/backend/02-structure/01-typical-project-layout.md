## 📂 Typical Project Layout

Let's take a look at a typical project layout:

```
project/
├── class/              # Business logic classes (request-scoped)
│   ├── Payment.js
│   └── User.js
├── controller/         # HTTP request handlers
│   ├── api/            # API endpoint controllers
│   │   ├── auth.js
│   │   └── users.js
│   └── page/           # HTML page controllers
│       ├── about.js
│       └── home.js
├── middleware/         # Route middleware functions
│   └── auth.js
├── public/             # Static assets (directly accessible)
│   └── assets/
│       ├── css/
│       │   └── app.css # Auto-generated by Tailwind
│       ├── img/
│       └── js/
├── route/              # Route definitions (subdomain-based)
│   ├── api.js          # Routes for api.example.com
│   └── www.js          # Routes for www.example.com
├── storage/            # App storage (logs, cache, uploads)
│   └── .cache/
├── view/               # HTML templates
│   ├── content/
│   ├── css/            # (Optional) Custom Tailwind entry points
│   ├── footer/

│   └── skeleton/
├── .env                # Environment variables (secrets, API keys)

└── package.json        # Project metadata & npm scripts
```

### 📁 Directory Breakdown

| Directory | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `class/` | Request-scoped service classes for business logic |
| `controller/` | HTTP handlers that process requests and return responses |
| `middleware/` | Functions that run before controllers (auth, logging, etc.) |
| `route/` | Route definitions, one file per subdomain |
| `view/` | HTML templates and partials |
| `public/` | Static files served directly to browsers |
| `storage/` | Runtime data (cache, logs, file uploads) |

### CLI Commands

Your `package.json` includes scripts to manage your project lifecycle:

```bash
# STAGE 1: DEVELOPMENT
# Starts dev server with hot-reload & automatic Tailwind CSS
npm run dev

# STAGE 2: BUILD
# Compiles and optimizes assets (CSS) for production
npm run build

# STAGE 3: PRODUCTION
# Starts the optimized server
npm start
```

**Note**: For production websites with DNS and SSL, use `odac web create` to register with Odac server.

Following this structure helps keep your code's responsibilities separate. Your routing logic lives in one place, your app logic in another, and your presentation files in a third. It's a recipe for success!
